<h1>Privacy Policy for WordBridge – Offline Dictionary</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 19, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to WordBridge – Offline Dictionary ("we," "our," or "the app"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>2.1 Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
<p>WordBridge stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search History:</strong> Words you have searched for in the dictionary</li>
    <li><strong>Favorite Words:</strong> Words you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your language preferences and app settings</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

<h3>2.2 Information Collected by Third Parties (AdMob)</h3>
<p>
    Our app displays non-personalized advertisements through Google AdMob. We have configured our app to request
    only non-personalized ads, which means AdMob does not track you across apps and websites for advertising purposes.
</p>
<p>
    AdMob may collect limited technical information to serve contextual ads, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Basic device information (device type, operating system version)</li>
    <li>IP address (for general location/language targeting only)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks) within this app only</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> We do NOT track your activity across other apps or websites. Ads shown are contextual
    (based on the app content) rather than personalized (based on your browsing history).
</p>
<p>
    For more information about how Google uses data, please review Google's Privacy Policy at
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search History & Favorites:</strong> To provide you with quick access to previously searched words and your favorite words. This data remains on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> AdMob uses limited technical data to display contextual (non-personalized) advertisements and measure ad performance. No cross-app or cross-site tracking is performed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>
    We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information. The only data sharing occurs through Google AdMob
    for advertising purposes, as described in Section 2.2.
</p>

<h2>5. Your Data Rights and Choices</h2>

<h3>5.1 Local Data</h3>
<p>You have full control over your locally stored data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can clear your search history at any time from the History screen</li>
    <li>You can remove favorites individually or clear all favorites from the Favorites screen</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2 Advertising</h3>
<p>
    WordBridge uses non-personalized advertising, which means:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will NOT see a tracking permission prompt when using the app</li>
    <li>Your activity is NOT tracked across other apps or websites</li>
    <li>Ads are contextual (based on app content) rather than based on your browsing history</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Since we do not use personalized ads, there is no need to opt out of ad tracking for this app. The app respects
    your privacy by default.
</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
    Our app is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    All data stored by the app remains locally on the device. AdMob advertising complies with the Children's Online
    Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and applicable regulations.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
<p>
    Since all app-specific data (search history, favorites, preferences) is stored locally on your device, the security
    of this data depends on your device's security settings. We recommend:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using device passcode/biometric authentication</li>
    <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
    <li>Only downloading apps from official app stores</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Offline Functionality</h2>
<p>
    WordBridge is designed to work completely offline. The entire dictionary database (containing 1.4+ million English
    words and 35,000+ Hindi words) is stored locally on your device. No internet connection is required to search for
    words or access definitions. Internet connectivity is only used for displaying advertisements.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
    Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically
    for any changes.
</p>

<h2>10. Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>
    Our app does not contain links to external websites or services, except for the advertising content provided by AdMob.
</p>
